                    I've been doing visual art since I was a little kid, but have started stepping into doing it Digitally.

                  <p>
                    I actually majored in Music Composition in college. Yeah. But nowadays I'm just a listener, and a player, not a writer. I play Bass guitar mainly these days, and here's my Spotify.

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p> I picked up a Canon EOS Rebel T7 a few months ago from a pawn shop. Go to pawn shops more by the way. They're awesome.
                <br> Anyway, I'm hooked on the camera now and take pictures whenever I'm somewhere new.
